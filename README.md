# Rebel - Ruby-flavored SQL

SQL-flavored Ruby.

```
You've been fighting yet another abstraction...
Aren't you fed up with object-relation magic?
But wait, here comes a humongous migration.
Is ActiveRecord making you sick?
To hell with that monstrous ARel expression!
Tell the truth, you were just wishing
That it was as simple as a here-string.
But could it keep some Ruby notation
Instead of silly interpolations?
Stop the menace, time for a revolution!

Rebel!

No magic
No bullshit
No layers
No wrappers
No smarty-pants
No sexy
No nonsense
No AST
No lazy loading
No crazy mapping

What you write is what you get: readable and obvious
What you write is what you meant: tasty and delicious

Wait, it doesn't execute!?
Just use your fave client gem, isn't that cute?

## Caveat

This is totes not secure in any fscking way you could ever imagine, and this is
valid for every single definition of *secure* you could ever think of (and even
the ones you don't).
